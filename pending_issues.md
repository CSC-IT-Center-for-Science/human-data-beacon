#Pending issues

* There is no support for InDels yet.
* The API v0.3 is not closed yet so some things can change in the near future:
  * Enpoint to get the beacon information: currently it is /info but it is being discussed to change it to /
  * Endpoint to ask the beacon: currently it is /query but it is being discussed to change it to /alleles. Maybe in the future more kinds of queries will be implemented and different endpoints might be needed.
* Data Use Conditions
  * This project has made a first attemp to represent both Consent Codes and ADA-M in JSON. This probably will change soon.
